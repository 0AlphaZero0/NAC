===========================================
This is a Project of Neurons Classification 
===========================================

It was a project created by students in their first year of master in Bioinformatics in 2018 by BLAIS Benjamin, COTTAIS Déborah, DE OLIVEIRA Lila, JOUAN Clément and THOUVENIN Arthur 


What is Neurons Classification ?
===============================

Neurons Classifocation is an instrument (software) which allows to a user (in the field of neuronal science) to classify in two categories (I and II) neurons thanks to differents electrophysiological parameters.  


Language and library used ?
===========================

Language = Python 2.7
Libraries = Scikit learn library with svm and MLPClassifier
	    Tkinter (graphic interface)
	    Matplotlib (graphic visualization)
	    Numpy (to manipulate the necessary table for sklearn)
	    tkFont (to modify the TKinter display font)
	    codecs (to load a file containing UTF-8 characters)
	    random (to use random variables)
	    tkFileDialog (to create a windows to load files)



How do I use Neurons Classification ?
=====================================

Please to refer to the manual of this software.


Modifications or contributions 
==============================

If you need or you want to add some methods, class in this software in the purpose of improving the classification of neurons or if a new method is discovered you can to push them    



Platform (system) support ?
=================

Linux
MacOS
Windows


Installing
==========

Before you can use the software, you have to install the python language and the differents libraries. 
If you are on linux system : this language and the libraries than the software use are already installed.
If you are on Windows or MacOS system : you have to install this differents things with the command make install
